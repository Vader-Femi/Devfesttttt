# Devfesttttt
 I'm bad at writing documantation
 We made a Wear Os version of the DevFest App we saw at DevFest 2022.
 I used:
 
 * Jetpack Compose for building the UI
 * Room Database as well the database
 * Wear capabilityClient APIs i.e MmessageClient to start the wear activity from your phone (because you can) and DataClient for sending your profile picture, email, and
   name to the Wear device 
 * Google's One Tap Client Client to log in and get the profile picture, email, and name
