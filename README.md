## Devfesttttt
 I'm bad at writing documantation.
 We made a Wear Os version of the DevFest App we saw at DevFest 2022.
 I used:
 
 * Jetpack Compose for building the UI
 * Room Database for well, the databases
 * Dagger-Hilt for dependency injection
 * Google's One Tap Client Client to log in and get the profile picture, email, and name from your phone
 * Wear's CapabilityClient APIs i.e MessageClient to start the wear activity from your phone (because you can) and DataClient for sending your profile picture, email,      and name to the paired Wear device (Shoutout to github.com/android/wear-os-samples)
